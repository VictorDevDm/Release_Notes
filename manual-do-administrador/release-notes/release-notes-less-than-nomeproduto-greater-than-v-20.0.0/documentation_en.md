# Viewing Total Licenses on the Portal

**US ID: US-NPD-8527**

In the portal, when accessing the "TOTAL CONTRACTED LICENSES" Dashboard, you can see how many licenses your company has registered. Both administrators and the support team have access to check this number, which is extracted from the database. This helps efficiently manage and control all the licenses your company owns.
