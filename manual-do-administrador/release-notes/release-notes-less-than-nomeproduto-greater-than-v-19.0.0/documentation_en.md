# App Remote View for Remote Access

**ID: US-NPD-7635**

Description: With the Remote View app, users can remotely access their Android devices through the portal. First, it is necessary to install the app and complete the enrollment process. Configuration with Mesh Central is done automatically. Once the app is opened, it initiates the connection and informs the user about the status of this connection. If the portal requests, the user receives a notification to confirm the connection. Additionally, the app requests permission to share the screen, and upon granting this permission, a screen-sharing session begins.
